phoss Peppol Access Point - when looking for the SMP, see [phoss SMP](https://github.com/phax/phoss-smp)

A complete open-source Peppol Access Point based on [phase4](https://github.com/phax/phase4).

It is a Spring Boot application that handles all the relevant Peppol specifications:
* Peppol AS4 specification - using [phase4](https://github.com/phax/phase4)
* Peppol SMP specification - using [peppol-smp-client](https://github.com/phax/peppol-commons)
* Peppol Network Reporting specification - using [peppol-reporting](https://github.com/phax/peppol-reporting)
* Peppol MLS specification - using [peppol-mls](https://github.com/phax/peppol-commons)

Features include:
* Inbound document reception with configurable forwarding (HTTP, S3, SFTP)
* Outbound document sending with automatic SMP lookup and SBDH creation
* Retry with exponential backoff and circuit breaker for both sending and forwarding
* Optional document validation via external verification service
* Duplicate detection on AS4 Message ID and SBDH Instance Identifier
* MLS (Message Level Status) support with SLA monitoring
* Peppol Reporting with scheduled submission
* Archival of completed transactions
* Sentry integration for error tracking

phoss AP is part of my Peppol solution stack. See https://github.com/phax/peppol for other components and libraries in that area.

## Build

Prerequisites:
* Java 21 or later
* Maven 3.x

```bash
mvn clean verify
```

## Quick Start

1. Set up a PostgreSQL database (see `docker-compose.yml` for an example)
2. Copy `phoss-ap-webapp/src/main/resources/application.properties` and adjust for your environment
3. Run the application:

```bash
java -jar phoss-ap-webapp/target/phoss-ap-webapp-*.jar
```

Or use Docker:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

See the [Running phoss AP](https://github.com/phax/phoss-ap/wiki/Running-phoss-AP) wiki page for detailed setup instructions.
